# Requirements for Arduino/ESP32 based LED Tower

Q: I want you to work as a Arduino code developer for an ESP32 board.

A: Sure, I'd be happy to help you generate code for an ESP32 board. Please let me know the specific requirements and functionalities you want to implement in the ESP32 board.

The ESP32 is a very versatile microcontroller with WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it a great choice for a wide variety of IoT projects. It's important to note that while I can help generate and troubleshoot code, you'll need to do the actual implementation on your end since I cannot physically interact with the hardware.

A: As the end user I want the R/Y/G/B LED Tower to be used to indicate information about on going events. I want the LEDS to be able to slow flash on and off or fast flash on and off or fade from off to on back to on or 

- ESP32
  - GPIO 4 - Red
  - GPIO 5 - Yellow
  - GPIO 6 - Green
  - GPIO 7 - Blue
- Arduino enviroment
- MQTT
  - accept command strings from the device/cmd topic
    - coomands are in the format of "color cmd"
      - where command is:
        - on
        - off
        - fflash (fast flash)
        - sflash (slow flash)
      - where color is
        - red
        - green
        - yellow
        - blue
      - addition commands:
        - all off
        - all on
      - commands can be issued asynchronously
  - states can be monitored on device/state
- Flash fast
- Flash slow
- Fade on and off

Note: Originally (July'23) I was playing with code generated by AI assistants (ChatGPT 4, Bard, Hugging Face) with developer modifications and enhancements. That didn't go well. I'm now sort of doing vibe programming with MS code and Claude. "So far so good" (Magnificent Seven, 1960) ;-)
